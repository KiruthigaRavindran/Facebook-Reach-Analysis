# Facebook-Reach-Analysis

OBJECTIVE:
         
For this project, we will mine the data from Facebook using Popsters ( online Analytics tool) and perform analytics to make business decisions.
         
BUSINESS PROBLEM:
         
 We are a brand-new company planning to launch a new energy drink. The Business goal is to make the brand name reach a large population as a first step. Many celebrities do paid partnerships with companies to promote products on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. We are in search of such a celebrity to launch and promote the product.

SOLUTION APPROACH:
        
At first, 50 cricket players are filtered based on the following criteria:
·       Demographic Location taken: India.
·       The player should have a Facebook account and should do paid partnership with companies.
·       The Player should promote our product within the estimated budget.
Once shortlisted, data about the players social account are collected and analyzed. With the results, a player is finalized for promoting the product.

DATASET:

The required dataset will be mined on Facebook (from the different player profiles that we have shortlisted) using the API and analyzed as per our needs and requirement. 

DATA TO BE COLLECTED/QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED FOR ANALYSIS:
·       What are the average Likes, Comments, shares per post for the last 3 months period?
·       What is the Number of views to number of followers ratio for all the players?
·       What is the Like Ratio, Comment Ratio, Share Ratio per post?
·       What is the Number of Promotional Posts that the players have posted?
·       Identifying the type of products promoted and frequency of posts for that product
·       What is the total number of posts saved by the users?
·       Which type of products reach a wider audience? (Clothing, accessories, food, etc.)
·       Google Analytics is also used to find which player has more searches.
By answering the above questions, we will be able to select a player as per our needs.
